          <p>‚ö° I‚Äôm always picking up new things in Power BI updates, DAX tricks, and data modeling so I can keep up with changes. I also get good ideas from the Analytics sessions called 'Groove and Grow', seeing how other developers approach their work.</p>

          <p>‚ö° What have we learned, we learned that the Analytics team also show case the same end results as we do for example the vehicles sales, would be interesting to know if they use the same data source as we do, if not then we could compare the data. As a team we are also learning that we are not ready yet to fully migrate to DM as we keep on finding out that we are still missing some fields which are not populated in DM. Mistakes are part of life, therefore we still make mistakes of underestimating the work that needs to be done, but we are trying to learn from these mistakes.</p>

          <p>‚ö° We are continuously discovering new ways to improve our Qlik apps, making the environment more robust and optimized. Mistakes do occur as we balance multiple workloads, but we see them as opportunities to learn, ensuring we don‚Äôt repeat the same errors. This mindset strengthens our ability to adapt and enhances our effectiveness as a team.</p>

As a team, we hold each other accountable for dedicating time to learning, often sharing challenges and solutions through our JAD sessions. Mistakes are part of the process when working with data, and we view them as opportunities to better understand flows, methodologies, and solutions to logical issues.</p>
